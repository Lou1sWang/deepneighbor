DeepNeighbor is a **Easy-to-use**,**Modular** and **Extendible** package of deep-learning based models along with lots of core components layers which can be used to easily build custom models.You can use any complex model with 
<br>`model.train()`ï¼Œwhich generate embeddings for users and items (Deep)
<br> and `model.search()`, which do ANN for seed user/item  (Neighbor) .
